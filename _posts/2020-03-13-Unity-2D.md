Ordering 

1. A GameObject that is lower on the screen (with a small y coordinate) should be drawn after a GameObject higher on the screen (with a larger y coordinate). This will enable it to appear on top. 
    `Edit`->`Project Settings`

    menu `Graphics`->`Camera Settings` -> 

        `Transparency Sort Mode` : `Custom Axis`
        `Transparency Sort Axis` : `0,1,0` 
        (This tells Unity to draw Sprites based on their position on the y-axis)

 2. Adjusting the Sprite Settings

     Hiersrchy-Inspector->`Sprite Renderer`->`Sprite Sort Point`:`Pivot`
     Project-Inspector->`Pivot`->`Bottom`->Apply




TileMap Collision

1. Project(Tile Folder tiles)-Inspector->`Collider Type` : `None`

2. Hierachy-Grid/Tilemap    

        <Tilemap Collider 2D> `Used By Composite` : checked
        <Rigidbody2D> `Body Type` : Static
        <Composite Collider 2D>
